# cryptoclustering

This was an exercise for unsupervised learning.  It was really interesting to be able to see immediately the benefits of cleaning the data and using fewer features (PCA data) in order to get better and more accurate results.  It was surprising to see that the original data actually resulted in an overlapping cluster, which actually defeats the purpose of having computer identify separate clusters.  

This is very important in data analysis, as accuracy in identifying trends and patterns is key.

Thank you for looking at my work!
